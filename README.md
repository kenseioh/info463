## General ##
We developed this input technique for smartwatches, but we simulated that in webiste using html. Basically, we want to reduce the fat finger problem and also keep the learnability. Our idea is inspired by the “magnifying lens”. The keyboard is enlarged as soon as user touches the screen. The whole keyboard area will be a “joystick” for user to select letters. There will be a call-out area displaying the magnified letters. The selected letter would be at the center and highlighted. Releasing the finger would automatically select that letter. We also have some gestures to increase efficiency. Swiping left to delete a letter, and swiping up to capitalize the keyboard.
